ðŸ©º 1. Pharmacistâ€™s Assistant â€“ Prescription Processing with RAG

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Extract text from handwritten prescriptions, match drugs with a verified database, check for errors, and generate structured orders.

ðŸ“Œ Pipeline Breakdown

âœ… Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Use IAM Dataset, RxNorm, or create synthetic prescription images.  
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehaksingal/illegible-medical-prescription-images-dataset
    used this dataset for medical handwritten prescriptions
	â€¢	Convert prescription images to grayscale and denoise (OpenCV).
    done
	â€¢	Apply Tesseract OCR or TrOCR (Hugging Face) for text extraction.

    train crnn on handwriting data, finetune with medical prescription data, use ner to identify drug names

âœ… Step 2: Text Processing & Drug Matching
	â€¢	Fine-tune CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) for handwriting recognition.
	â€¢	Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify drug names and dosages (SpaCy, BioBERT).
	â€¢	Implement fuzzy matching (Levenshtein Distance) to match prescriptions with the official drug database.


ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Training CRNN on IAM Dataset (Base Model)

ðŸ“Œ Why?
	â€¢	The IAM dataset is well-labeled for general handwriting recognition.
	â€¢	It provides a good starting point for training the CRNN model.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset:
	â€¢	IAM Dataset â†’ Contains handwritten words with transcriptions.
	â€¢	Images: Handwritten text samples
	â€¢	Labels: Transcription of words

ðŸ“Œ Training CRNN on IAM:
	â€¢	Load IAM dataset & preprocess images
	â€¢	Train a CNN-LSTM (CRNN) model for general handwriting recognition
	â€¢	Loss: CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification)
	â€¢	Save the trained model


âœ… Step 3: RAG Integration for Drug Validation & Recommendations
	â€¢	Vectorize drug-related documents from DrugBank, MedlinePlus, OpenFDA.
	â€¢	Store them in a vector database (FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone).
	â€¢	Convert extracted prescription text into embeddings (Hugging Face BGE, OpenAI embeddings).
	â€¢	Retrieve relevant drug information from the knowledge base.

âœ… Step 4: Order Generation & Validation
	â€¢	Verify drug interactions using RAG-powered retrieval.
	â€¢	If missing details, prompt the pharmacist for clarification.
	â€¢	Generate structured order in JSON format.

âœ… Step 5: Web UI & Deployment
	â€¢	Build a frontend using Streamlit or React for order validation.
	â€¢	Deploy backend using FastAPI.
	â€¢	Host on AWS Lambda, Hugging Face Spaces, or GCP.

ðŸ“¸ 2. Diagnostic Assistant â€“ Medical Image & Symptoms Analysis with RAG

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Analyze medical images, patient symptoms, and history to assist in disease diagnosis.

ðŸ“Œ Pipeline Breakdown

âœ… Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Use open-source datasets (NIH Chest X-ray, CheXpert, Brain MRI Kaggle datasets).
	â€¢	Resize and normalize images using OpenCV and PIL.
	â€¢	Convert symptoms & patient history into structured features (one-hot encoding).

âœ… Step 2: Model Selection & Training
	â€¢	Use EfficientNet, ResNet, or Vision Transformer (ViT) for medical image classification.
	â€¢	Train LSTM or Random Forest on symptom data for disease prediction.
	â€¢	Fine-tune BioBERT, ClinicalBERT to process patient records.

âœ… Step 3: RAG Integration for Explainability & Decision Support
	â€¢	Index medical literature (PubMed, clinical guidelines, case studies).
	â€¢	Store in a vector database (FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone).
	â€¢	Convert symptoms + image findings into query embeddings.
	â€¢	Retrieve similar cases, research papers, and explanations using an LLM (Med-PaLM, GPT-4).

âœ… Step 4: Diagnostic Report Generation
	â€¢	Combine model predictions + retrieved case studies.
	â€¢	Use SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability.
	â€¢	Generate a PDF report summarizing findings.

âœ… Step 5: Web UI & Deployment
	â€¢	Build an interactive UI using Streamlit or Flask.
	â€¢	Provide heatmaps (Grad-CAM) for model explainability.
	â€¢	Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or AWS for real-time usage.
